# Salary Classification
A final project assigned by SanberCode Python - Data Science Online Class to classify salary from each person using Sklearn with Random Forest Classifier and GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning

# Prerequisites
Run pip or conda to install the followings:
1. pandas
2. numpy
3. sklearn

# Coder Notes
So far, I decided to use Random Forest Classifier for the algorithm and GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning. For future improvement, I could include RandomizedSearchCV as well.
