# Salary Classification
A final project assigned by SanberCode Python - Data Science Online Class (Batch 0820) to classify salary from each person. I'm using Sklearn with Random Forest Classifier and also GridSearch CV for the hyperparameter tuning.

# Prerequisites
Run pip or conda to install the followings:
1. pandas
2. numpy
3. sklearn

# Coder Notes
So far, I decided to use Random Forest Classifier for the algorithm and GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning. For future improvement, I may include RandomizedSearchCV as well.
